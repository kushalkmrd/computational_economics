        "- There will be 10 periods. Players begin with 70 health.\n",
        "- Each period, the player harvests some amount of money (this amount is detailed below)\n",
        "- After harvesting, the player's health degenerates (this amount is detailed below)\n",
        "- After health degeneration, the player must spend money on Health Investments and Life Investments. Money spent on Health Investments increases health, while money spent on Life Investments gives the player Life Enjoyment. Any money not spent carries over into the next period.\n",
        "- A player dies if their health ever goes below 0. If a player dies, they receive 0 Life Enjoyment for the remaining periods.\n",
        "- The goal is to maximize total Life Enjoyment across all periods.\n",

        "1. The player earns income by harvesting black dots in a region designated by M x N cells. In our parameters (M = N = 100)\n",
        "2. The player can select any set of contiguous W columns to harvest. In our parameters (W = 10)\n",
        "3. When fully healthy, there are T black dots dispersed across M x W cells each period. Each black dot is worth v. In our parameters T = 100 and v = 1\n",
